# Sitecore-ReCaptcha-form
in my fork, i made some modification to the source code in order to have it compatible with SC9.0+ as it had a namespace that is only available with sc9.1
also changed the field template cshtml file a bit in order to adapt the multiple use of recaptcha in single page with more than one form.

thought that it will be useful to share.
Happy coding
